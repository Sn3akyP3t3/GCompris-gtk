        Gravity is universal and Newton's law of universal gravitation extends gravity beyond earth.This force of
        gravitational attraction is directly dependent upon the masses of both objects and inversely proportional
        to the square of the distance that separates their centers.

        Since the gravitational force is directly proportional to the mass of both interacting objects, more massive
        objects will attract each other with a greater gravitational force. So as the mass of either object increases,
        the force of gravitational attraction between them also increases but this force is inversely proportional to
        the square of the separation distance between the two interacting objects, more separation distance will
        result in weaker gravitational forces.

        Increase and decrease the size of the planets at the two ends to see how the force on the
        spaceship changes with changes in the size and distance. This force results in acceleration of the
        spaceship.

        With every level the speed of the spaceship will increase.
