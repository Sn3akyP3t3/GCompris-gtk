The activity deals with mixing primary colors of paint and also primary colors of light.

In case of paints the inks absorb different colors of light falling on it, subtracting it from what you see. The more ink you add, the more light is absorbed, and the darker the combined color gets. We can mix just three primary colors to make many new colors. The primary colors for paint/ink are Cyan (a special shade of blue), Magenta (a special shade of pink), and Yellow.

Whereas in case of light it is just the opposite of mixing color with paints! The more light you add the lighter the resultant color will get. Primary colors of light are red, green and blue.

Switch between paint and light to see how they differ.
